# Description:
# Provides cmdlet and process elevation in PowerShell without creating a new
# console window.
#
# So here's how it works: In order to run an administrative command and get the
# contents on the same command-line in Windows NT, some clever trickery needs
# to happen. Because of the ways that user and process management are currently
# implemented, you cannot start a process with only the security privileges of
# another user; you have to explicitly execute the process as the other user.
#
# While it is novel to start a process as another user, especially with the
# powershell.exe -runas flag, it is another level of conventional difficulty to
# return the command output to the original console instance.
#
# This is where kernel IPC comes into play. By setting up a named pipe in the
# admin process, output can be returned through said pipe to the user process.

# representation into base64 for use as a command-line encoded argument later.

.SYNOPSIS
	Execute a command as an elavated user.

.DESCRIPTION
	The Invoke-AsAdmin cmdlet executes the command specified by the arguments as an elavated user.

	When the command is a single string, it is executed by the Invoke-Expression cmdlet. Otherwise, the ampersand (&) shell command is used.

	The command line is then executed in an elavated process that is different from the caller. The output is serialized and transfered as a pipeline stream to the caller. If the output is not serializable, it is converted to a text stream by means of the Out-String cmdlet.

	The Invoke-AsAdmin cmdlet will not open a new console window. Instead, it executes the command utilizing the same console session as the caller process. All environment variables are evaluated in the context of the caller process.

.EXAMPLE
	PS> Invoke-AsAdmin {cmd /c mklink $env:USERPROFILE\bin\test.exe test.exe}
	Creates a symbolic link to test.exe in the $env:USERPROFILE\bin folder. Note that $env:USERPROFILE is evaluated in the context of the caller process.

.EXAMPLE
	PS> Invoke-AsAdmin {Get-Process -IncludeUserName | Sort-Object UserName | Select-Object UserName, ProcessName}
	Obtains a process list with user name information, sorted by UserName. Because the System.Diagnostics.Process objects are not serializable, if you want to transform the output of Get-Process, enclose the command with curly braces to ensure that pipeline processing should be done in the called process.
